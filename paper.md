> In the humanities starting out with a data set to be understood except through statistical summary doesn’t jive with the tendency to focus on single objects, so I choose to use statistics to estrange the object and then bring it back into focus in ways students already understand but didn’t realize would be our destination.

The pedagogy I am about to discuss is perhaps best described as a pedagogy of exhaustion. At the beginning of a semester in which I teach the freshman honor’sI English seminar, I assign students an eight thousand word short story to read before the first day of class. When they walk into the room on the first day, I first quiz them to let them know I’m serious about them getting work done, and then I let them discuss the story however they are used to doing. Typically this involves a fairly formless series of unconnected statements which often drag up things like symbols — whatever those are (because they don’t know; they just know symbols are important). What the students can’t know at the end of this first class is that we are going to spend the next 3 weeks on this one text. 3 weeks. 8000 words. Exhaustion.

We spend 3 weeks on 8000 words, but, by the end of it, they know that text. They know it. They know something in a way they have too often not known it before. Not by what they already thought they knew, but by prolonged entanglement with the object itself. In some ways, this particular pedagogical moment is nothing more than a working out in the humanities of Pound's story of Aggasiz and the fish.

The story we read is "The Most Dangerous Game" written by Richard Connell and published in Collier's in 1924. I chose it because of how well established it is in American popular culture and because it will enter the public domain in 2020. While many of you may not have read the short story, all of you will know its essential plot of a famous hunter ending up being hunted. It is almost a rule, I think -- let's call it Laudun's Rule -- that if a television series goes long enough, it will feature an episode with a version of "the most dangerous game." (My favorite is Archer's "El Contador.")

My copy of the story began life as a PDF linked from the story's Wikipedia page. I stripped it to bare text, and I then re-produce it as a PDF with the same number of pages as students in the class. On the second day of class, after students have run out of steam with their own analyses, I ask them to summarize the story. They flounder, because writing a summary of fiction is somewhat difficult. How do you prioritize events within a story?

My suggestion is to them to let the text do the work: I assign each student the task of designating one sentence from a given pageant that best represents what happens on that page. We compile the 16 sentences and then check for redundancy, with the goal of either eliminating redundancy or transforming it into a qualification or digression that adds nuance to the summary. {A sample summary here would be great.}

As we discuss the strengths of this method, I do not use words like *set* and *subset* and instead of distinguishing between extractive and abstractive methods, we discuss the difference between quotative and paraphrased summaries. My argument for this method is that it is mechanical. "Let the text do the work," I tell them. With each page averaging between 450 to 500 words, a 20-word sentence achieves a 20-to-1 compression.

What I stress for them is that writing a summary requires discipline, which in most instances we recognize as a method, a theoretically-informed method, which is nothing more than a reliable, repeatable process with clear instructions. `Capture one sentence per page; compile; reduce redundancy` is a clear, repeatable method.

Having demonstrated the utility of such an approach, I then ask them to tell me not what the story means but how the story achieve its possible meaning(s). After all, whether it is oral or written, discourse is nothing more than a string of words. In the stream of oral discourse, we define a text as a chunk of words that can be removed from one event and transported to another. Portability, then, is a key element of texts, and understanding the dynamics of removing a text from one context, holding it in the brain, and then inserting it into another context is one of the central foci of my home field of folklore studies.

Written texts come pre-packaged -- _prêt à porter_, if you like. They are fixed string of words, a coded sequence we so readily ingest/download that we don't think about the nature of the operation, until we are stuck in a room with an English professor. My job is to convince my students, and perhaps you, that texts are nothing more than meaning-making machines and as such can be mechanically broken down, as some of us still do with other machines in our world. The trick is to piece out the parts and much of what comes next is creating different parts schedules that can, perhaps, be overlaid to discover how a text works.

Much of what follows is simply a variation on a theme: how can various forms of counting reveal the way a text work? Simple descriptive statistics deployed in the service of understanding how 8017 words make up 700 sentences that make up 206 paragraphs that make up 1 story that has become in its almost 100 year a history an important part of our cultural matrix.

## Part Schedule 1: Word Frequencies

One of the things I regularly skip past is how we define the constituent elements of a population. While I might find discussions about tokenization thought-provoking -- e.g., is the contraction *can't* one word or two? -- I keep the discussion, and the code, focused on commonsensical perspectives. And that means that *can't* is one word and so is *you've* because to break them up into either the somewhat nonsensical NLP conventions of *ca* and *n't* is more into the weeds than I wish to wander. I also don't worry about stemming, for reasons that I hope will become clear in a moment.

Thus, when I tell them that the 8000 word story is composed of a little less than two thousand words,

%%  Maybe start with the bigger units, effecting a zoom in.

Quotatives fit in here somewhere.
